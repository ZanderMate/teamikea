What is the best combination of pokemon for ...?
This question has plagued all who have strived to be a pokemon master. Pika-Choose is here to help!

## Concept: User-Story

As a dedicated pokemon trainer, I want an application to view the average scores of a pokemon team based on the goal that I can create the most effective teams of pokemon.

## How to use

1. This will be the landing page for the application. Click, "Create Team" button to start a team.

2. To add a team, enter in the name and hit submit. You can now go to the view pokemon page to add your pokemon to your team.

3. You can view stats on the individual pokemon before adding to your team. Add the selected pokemon to your team by selecting "Add to Team"

4. Once your team is built with your 6 Pokemon, you can view the overall average stats of the team by viewing the teams page by selecting "View Teams".
